Design Decisions

Model Choice: Used google/t5-v1_1-small for its medium size, local compatibility, and accuracy in text-to-text tasks like question-answering.
Memory Buffer: Implemented a sliding window (5 turns) with a system prompt to maintain context and encourage factual responses.
Modularity: Split code into model_loader.py (loads pipeline), chat_memory.py (manages history), and interface.py (runs CLI).
Pipeline: Used Hugging Faceâ€™s text2text-generation pipeline for versatile and accurate response generation.
